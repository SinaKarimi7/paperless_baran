## paperless Baran
To run this code u need to install nodejs ,mongodb and git.
Then :
```sh
git clone https://github.com/barangroup/paperless_baran.git
cd paperless_baran
npm install
bower install
bower client/public
```

Now u can run server :
```sh
node ./bin/www
```
it's recommended to use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) fo development and [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) for public release.
